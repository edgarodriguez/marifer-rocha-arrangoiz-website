I’m a Clinical Psychologist with 15 years of experience working in institutional clinics, teaching at universities, and practising privately with individuals and couples using the model of [Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)](https://iceeft.com/what-is-eft-public/),developed by Dr Sue Johnson.


I’m a Chartered Member of the British Psychological Society (BPS) and a Member of the British Emotionally Focused Therapy Centre (BEFT).

My dedication to this profession has been the driving force of my life. Apart from my bachelor’s in psychology, I hold a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, both earned with honours. I also have a master’s degree in clinical psychology, during which I participated in an International Mobility Program and received a scholarship from the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT).

Committed to continuous learning and specialisation, I have gained experience, especially working with people who have experienced trauma in their lives. EFT provides a “safe haven”, where even in couples or individual therapy, there is a map for us to create enough security in the room to explore your inner world as it unfolds in the present moment of your therapy sessions. 

With a deep foundation in [Attachment Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyCHT9AbD_Y&list=PL9JGldiXzvlUDLO5uKDsa-Pomus6Y6l1g&index=5), EFT allows me to order your emotional experiences and guide you towards your sense of integration, self-regulation and confidence to get closer to your significant others and build secure connections with them. 

As a [Highly Sensitive Person](https://hsperson.com), I deeply care about others, and this trait gives my life meaning and purpose. In every session, I strive to create a positive impact—not just for the individuals I work with but for the world as a whole and future generations. When we liberate ourselves from the [negative relational cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4VhRHsjm8) in our more meaningful relationships, we get out of constant suffering and start contributing to a better and more compassionate world.


Both in my professional journey and in my life as a mother and wife, my mission is to use my humanity to help people embrace their inner vulnerability and to use it to connect with themselves and with others, having the certainty that this will foster a powerful and unbreakable chain of human connection and well-being in the world.

I would be honoured to meet you, support you in your emotional journey, and walk alongside you in this shared mission of connection and orientation to your personal objectives.

I offer bilingual (English-Spanish), remote/online private therapy via Zoom.

## Testimonials
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

*You were there for me when I was first facing depression and anxiety, and also when you insisted that my parents take family therapy. I remember how committed you were to helping me improve things at home, even when they decided not to continue with therapy.*
	
*I am now financially independent, I have a new job that I like, I don't need pills for my depression and anxiety, and in general, I don't think I've ever been as good with myself as I am now. Your support in those years of therapy really made a difference in my life. I don't think I would have gotten this far without your help, and that's why I wanted to say: Thank you!*
